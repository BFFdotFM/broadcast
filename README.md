# BFF.fm Broadcast

This repo contains BFF.fm's Azuracast LiquidSoap config. Since we deployed Azuracast alongside some existing infrastructure (mainly Google Workplace which we use for identity, and Creek which we use as our CMS and playlist source-of-truth) we've bolted into Azuracast quite heavily at the LiquidSoap level, while wanting to going outside of Azuracast's package guardrails.

While there's quite a lot of cross-dependency, hopefully you'll find these little modules useful.
